# AnimalRace
Animal Race for Class
My program starts off using an Animal function that we used in class to assign properties to my animal function.
I modified the this.report function from returning a value and adding an if and else statement to define winners.

I modified the this.run function, adding variable tired and alert which subtract and add speed respectively depending if the user input focus is higher or lower then the random number between 1-10.

I added a makeAnimal function with parameter CreatAnimalType to reuse code. I combined the variables in my function to the Animal function and returned my variable.

i then created object that used the makeAnimal function.

create a while loop so i could visually see the race.

then i console log the ending of the race declaring winner and loooser  by calling the object with report function.
